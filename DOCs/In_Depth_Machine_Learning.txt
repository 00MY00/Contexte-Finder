In-Depth Machine Learning:
Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data and improve performance over time. Key concepts include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

1. Supervised Learning:
   - Involves training a model on labeled data.
   - Common algorithms include linear regression, support vector machines, and neural networks.

2. Unsupervised Learning:
   - Deals with unlabeled data, aiming to discover hidden patterns.
   - Clustering algorithms like K-means and hierarchical clustering are widely used.

3. Reinforcement Learning:
   - Focuses on training models through a reward-punishment mechanism.
   - Used in applications like game playing and robotics.

ML frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn provide tools to develop and deploy ML models efficiently. Understanding bias-variance tradeoff, overfitting, and model evaluation metrics are crucial for building robust ML solutions.

Advanced Python Programming:
Python is a versatile language used for various applications, from web development to data science. Advanced Python programming involves understanding decorators, generators, context managers, and metaclasses. Decorators allow you to modify the behavior of a function or class. Generators enable you to iterate over data efficiently. Context managers facilitate resource management with the 'with' statement. Metaclasses allow you to control the creation of classes, making Python a powerful tool for dynamic programming.

Popular libraries for advanced Python include:
1. NumPy and pandas for data manipulation
2. Flask and Django for web development
3. TensorFlow and PyTorch for machine learning
4. asyncio for asynchronous programming

Effective use of these libraries can significantly enhance your Python programming skills.
